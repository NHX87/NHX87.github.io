						<h3>Education</h3>
							<p>I earned a Bachelor of Science in Psychology from the University of Central Florida. While my degree may seem outside the traditional data analytics path, it laid a strong foundation in human behavior, decision-making, and communication—skills that are essential in translating complex data into meaningful insights for stakeholders.</p>
							<p>My background in psychology helps me think from the consumer’s perspective, especially when designing and evaluating revenue automation strategies. I consider not just what the data shows, but *why* consumers behave a certain way, and how we can align pricing, promotions, or automation rules with real-world behavior. This approach has added value to my work by ensuring that data-driven decisions are rooted in both analytical rigor and human understanding.</p>

								<h3>Experience</h3>
									<p><strong>Senior Data Analyst, Revenue Strategy - Royal Caribbean Group</strong></p>
									<p>In my current role as a Senior Data Analyst at Royal Caribbean Group, I moved beyond traditional data analysis to develop end-to-end frameworks for revenue automation. Utilizing tools like Azure Databricks and Azure Data Factory, I built scalable data pipelines that integrate automation changes directly into live Power BI dashboards. These dashboards, equipped with auto-refresh capabilities, allow stakeholders to efficiently audit changes, provide real-time feedback, and continuously improve automation processes.</p>
									<p>My background in psychology has been instrumental in understanding consumer behavior and applying that perspective to revenue automation. By considering how passengers make purchasing decisions, I designed automation rules and workflows that align business strategy with real-world consumer patterns, driving incremental revenue and improving departmental and company KPIs.</p>
									
									<p><strong>Analyst & Senior Analyst, Revenue Management - Royal Caribbean Group</strong></p>
									<p>As an Analyst and later Senior Analyst in Revenue Management, I developed a deep understanding of business practices, revenue metrics, and performance optimization. By applying advanced SQL and Python analytics, I successfully generated over $10 million in incremental revenue for my portfolio of ships operating in the Caribbean. This role also solidified my ability to communicate complex findings to non-technical stakeholders, enhancing their ability to make data-driven decisions with confidence.</p>
									
									<p><strong>Data and Enrollment Coordinator - Embrace Families Solutions (Public Allies Central Florida Program)</strong></p>
									<p>Through the Public Allies Central Florida program, I gained hands-on experience working with large datasets in the Pathways to Home Division. I tracked thousands of client records and produced monthly and quarterly program reports using advanced Excel, SQL, and Tableau. This experience taught me how to present data effectively, improving stakeholder engagement and transparency in program performance.</p>
									
									<p><strong>Activities Coordinator & Education Specialist - Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission</strong></p>
									<p>During my time with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, I developed leadership and instructional skills while serving as Activities Coordinator and Education Specialist at the Everglades Youth Camp. This role challenged me to quickly adapt to dynamic environments, enhance my communication skills, and make strategic decisions under pressure—skills that continue to benefit my work in analytics and leadership today.</p>

								<h3>Career Goals</h3>
									<p>My career goals are centered around three key pillars:</p>
									<ol>
									    <li><strong>Driving Business Value Through Data-Driven Solutions:</strong> I aim to leverage my skills in analytics, automation, and storytelling to provide innovative solutions that enhance decision-making and drive measurable growth within any organization I join.</li>
									    <li><strong>Continuous Learning and Adaptation:</strong> As the data landscape evolves, I am committed to expanding my technical skills and leadership capabilities, ensuring that I stay ahead of emerging trends and technologies to remain a valuable asset to my team.</li>
									    <li><strong>Mentorship and Empowerment:</strong> I strive to support and guide aspiring analysts and collaborators by sharing knowledge, fostering curiosity, and helping others reach their potential through mentorship and collaboration.</li>
									</ol>
									<p>Through dedication to these principles, I am confident in my ability to create meaningful impact, grow within my career, and contribute positively to the organizations and communities I serve.</p>
